# The-Catcher-s-Hello

Hello wonderful world!

I am the Sardine Catcher. I love sardines! I go on exciting adventures all over the Universe to catch them. Oh what fascinating creatures! I have set out to learn about this new world and it's sardines. I say new because I have never been. I can't wait to see what awaits me! Let's go!
